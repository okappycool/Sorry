            I am deeply sorry for the hurt I've caused you. Reflecting on our time together, I realize how much our relationship means to me and the wonderful moments we've shared. Please let me show you how much I care and how committed I am to making things right.
            Please forgive me one last time , I really love you and want things to work between us .
